# My dotfiles & configuration.

This repository contains the various dotfiles and configuration settings that I use to power my environment.  I currently use [Manjaro i3 Community Edition ](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) across a range of laptops and Virtual Machines.  

The repository includes the *dotfiles* script, in the root directory, which allows for the installation and maintenance of the files and settings.  The aim of the *dotfiles* script is to provide a convention based way in which to manage your files and settings without the need of a configuration file.  The script does not rely on any third party tool or framework to prevent reliance on depreciated code.  While I use a limited (and opinionated) set of tools, the convention based approach will work for any type of file you wish to add. 

This is my repo and designed to be useful to me.  I have spent a number of years trying to tame the files within but I do not focus a lot of time on the code.  If you would find it useful then I have no issue you with you forking it and using it to manage your dotfiles and settings.  If you see something you want to change or fix then I am open to PR's. 


## Getting Started


In order to get started you should clone this repo with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/andy-crouch/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

This will download **my** dotfiles and settings.  While slightly interesting, you will most probably want to read through it to see how it works before copying in versions of your dotfiles and settings.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

If you want to just install my environment then ensure you have the applications installed in the [Prerequisites](prerequisites) section above and run:

```
cd ~/.dotfiles
./dotfiles -i
```

## Running the tests
